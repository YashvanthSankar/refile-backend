# MazeMaster

## Project Description

**MazeMaster** is a C++ application built with the Qt framework, designed to generate, solve, and analyze mazes with a highly interactive graphical user interface (GUI). The system generates random mazes using recursive backtracking, solves them with multiple pathfinding algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and A\*), and provides advanced path analysis (e.g., path length, number of turns, dead ends). The Qt-based GUI features dynamic visualization, animating the solving process, and user controls for maze size and algorithm selection. Developed for a college Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course, this project demonstrates all OOP concepts—encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and composition—through a modular, robust design for a team of five, aiming to deliver an engaging and technically impressive solution.

## OOP Concepts Applied

- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes in `Cell` (e.g., `visited`, `walls`) and `Maze` (e.g., `grid`) are protected, with public methods like `getVisited()` and `setWall()` controlling access to ensure data integrity and hide implementation details.
- **Inheritance**: The abstract base class `Solver` defines shared attributes (e.g., `maze` reference) and methods, with subclasses `BFSSolver`, `DFSSolver`, and `AStarSolver` inheriting to implement specific pathfinding logic.
- **Polymorphism**: The virtual `solve()` method in `Solver` is overridden in subclasses (e.g., `BFSSolver` uses a queue, `DFSSolver` uses a stack, `AStarSolver` uses heuristics), enabling dynamic algorithm selection at runtime.
- **Abstraction**: The `Solver` class provides an abstract interface with pure virtual methods (e.g., `solve()`), hiding complex pathfinding logic from the user and ensuring modular design.
- **Composition**: The `Maze` class is composed of `Cell` objects forming a grid; `Analyzer` contains a `Path` (vector of `Cell` pointers) for analysis; `MainWindow` integrates `Maze`, `Solver`, and `Analyzer` for GUI rendering and interaction.

## Team Members

- **Team Member 2** (Name: \[Your Name Here\]): Develops the abstract `Solver` class and `BFSSolver`, focusing on inheritance and polymorphism for robust pathfinding.
- **Team Member 3** (Name: \[Your Name Here\]): Implements `DFSSolver` and `AStarSolver` to extend polymorphism, enabling comparison of multiple algorithms.
- **Team Member 4** (Name: \[Your Name Here\]): Creates the `Analyzer` class for advanced metrics (path length, turns, dead ends, runtime), utilizing composition and encapsulation.
- **Team Member 5** (Name: \[Your Name Here\]): Builds the Qt GUI with input fields, algorithm selection, and animated visualization, integrating all components for a polished user experience.
